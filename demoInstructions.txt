Welcome to Smiley Spear Avoidance Training!

You are a smiley face.  You can't see very well.
Deadly spears are approaching. Your goal is to survive.

Actual locations of the approaching spears are in red.  Every red spear
is in one of two categories: high or low.
The locations these spears appear to you (on account of your poor vision)
are in green.

Based on your sensory perception (green spears), you must classify the
location of the actual spears (red spears).  Fortunately, you can choose
your brain's method of interpreting sensory stimuli. 

Choose your brain's classifier wisely: MLE, MAP, or LDA.  Each has its strengths
and weaknesses.
